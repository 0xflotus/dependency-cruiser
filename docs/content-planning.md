## Why - what do I want to achieve?
1. I want to make visitors use dependency-cruiser on their project(s). Metrics:
    - npm downloads
    - github stars

2. I want people to find dependency-cruiser easily in the organic
results of search engines. Metrics:
    - in the top 5 of search results on duckduckgo, google,
      bing (in that order) for the search terms
      - typescript dependency graph
      - ...
    - referals in analytics

## Who? What's the conversation?
Software engineers (including architects) working on javascript, typescript,
livescript or coffeescript projects.
